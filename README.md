# form-project

Creating a page for a signup page.
I will be recreating the example page offered by The Odin Project.

I need a photo and a logo on the left.
On the right side, I need a heading, a main/form part, and a footer including the 'create account' button.

The forms needed:
First Name (required)
Last Name (required)
Email (required)
Phone Number
Password (required)
Confirm Password (required)

Below the Create Acccount button, I should also have a 'already have an account?' link
